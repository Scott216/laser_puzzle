Laser cut snowflake puzzle

I made this out of 1/8" acrylic.  It's a pretty difficult puzzle to put together. 

To generate the puzzle pieces I used this inkscape plugin:

I got the vector snowflake patterns from here:

For my first version I just laser etched the snowflakes in the acrylic, but there wasn't enough contrast between the snowflake and clear acrylic.  So for version 2 I covered the acrylic with painter's tape, then etched the snowflakes through the tape and into the acrylic.  So now I had a mask for spray painting.  I used white spray paint to fill in all the snowflakes.  After the paint dried I removed the painter's tape and used the laser to cut out the puzzle pieces.  I found that if I cut out the acrylic with the painted snowflakes facing down, I had less burning of the paint by the laser.
